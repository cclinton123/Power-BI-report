Scenario: A manager wants to see a report on the company's latest sales figures. They've requested an executive summary of:

•	Which month and year had the most profit?

•	Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?

•	Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

Visual 1: Profit by date
